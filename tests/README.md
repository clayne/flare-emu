# Testing

There are currently four IDAPython scripts used to test `flare-emu`.

* flare_emu_test.py - Basic tests of the `emulateRange` and `iterate` features
* flare_emu_test_hooks.py - Tests the naive implementations of all the supported CRT and Windows API hooks
* objc2_analyzer_test.py - Tests the basic functionality of objc2_analyzer.py
* flare_emu_test_discovery.py - Tests the `emulateFrom` feature with `strict` mode turned off to enable code discovery and fix anti-disassembly tricks present in the test binary

The `flare_emu_test_<arch>` binaries are Mach-O executables that should be tested with the `flare_emu_test.py` Python script.

The `flare_emu_winhooks_test_x86.exe` binary is a PE executable that should be tested with the `flare_emu_test_hooks.py` Python script. You may need to apply the `printf` name to the `printf` function in the binary if the binary analysis component fails to do so.

The `objc2_analyzer_test_<arch>` binaries are Mach-O executables that should be loaded into IDA Pro and tested with the `objc2_analyzer_test.py` IDAPython script.

The `flare_emu_test_discovery` binary is a Mach-O executable that should be loaded into IDA Pro and tested with the `flare_emu_test_discovery.py` IDAPython script.

Check the printed output of these test scripts to ensure there are no reported errors. Note that r2pipe errors may be the result of issues in Radare2, in which case they can be ignored.

To test the idalib integration (using idalib), run `$ pytest tests/test_flare_emu_idalib.py`
